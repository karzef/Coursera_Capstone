    "I have recently discussed with investors the idea of designing and creating a new website which will allow to compare eateries between two major cities. We will be using New York and Toronto as pilot. The main idea of this website would be to score each city on several factors and compare how similar or dissimilar eateries are between them. Eateries would include Restaurant, cafe and Bars.  \n",
    "Similarity between the 2 cities will be analyze by measuring the following range factor: diversity (style, origin), accessibility (distance to transport ) ,cost , quality (rating) and density (population/eateries)\n",
